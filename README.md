# Project Description: Retail Item Recommendation System

This project is a web application designed to enhance the shopping experience by providing personalized item recommendations. Utilizing collaborative filtering and association rule mining techniques, the application helps users discover similar products and identify trending items within a retail dataset.

## Key Technologies
- **Flask**: A lightweight web framework for building the application.
- **Pandas and NumPy**: Libraries for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Scikit-learn**: Used to calculate cosine similarity between items.
- **Mlxtend**: Employed for association rule mining to find relationships between products.

## Data Loading and Processing
The application begins by loading a retail transaction dataset from a CSV file. It converts item IDs and bill IDs to string format for consistency and creates a mapping of item IDs to their corresponding names for easy reference.

## Recommender System Implementation
The recommendation system leverages two main approaches:
- **Collaborative Filtering**: User-item interactions are transformed into a matrix to compute item similarities using cosine similarity.
- **Association Rule Mining**: The Apriori algorithm identifies frequent itemsets, generating rules that reveal relationships between different products.

## Trending Items
To keep users informed about popular products, the application calculates daily sales quantities and growth rates for each item, highlighting the top trending items.

## Web Interface
The user-friendly interface features a homepage displaying trending items, selected association rules, and a form for users to input item IDs for recommendations. Upon submission, the application retrieves similar items and corresponding sales data, presenting this information in an intuitive format.

## Error Handling
The application includes robust error handling to manage invalid item ID submissions, ensuring users receive informative feedback and suggestions.

This Retail Item Recommendation System effectively combines data analysis techniques to create a tailored shopping experience, making it easier for customers to find products they'll love.
